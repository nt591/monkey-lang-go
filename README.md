# Writing an Interpreter in Go

This repository is the work for following along with the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](www.interpreterbook.com).

My main focus is not to learn Go, but to learn enough Go to understand how interpreters work. My career goal is to work on a compilers team within the next year or so. I'll be using this book and his followup [Writing A Compiler In Go](www.compilerbook.com), along with the [Stanford course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/course/) and the book [Modern Compiler Implementationa in ML](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/ml/)
